### Deprecations
- Remove deprecated `Omnibus.configure` method
- Deprecate `Omnibus.config.value` in favor of `Config.value` instead
- Deprecate `Omnibus.project_root` in favor of `Config.project_root`
- Deprecate [DSL] `platform` in favor of `Ohai['platform']`
- Deprecate [DSL] `platform_family` in favor of `Ohai['platform_family']`
- Deprecate [DSL] `platform_version` in favor of `Ohai['platform_version']`
- Deprecate [DSL] `build_dir` in favor of `Config.build_dir`
- Deprecate [DSL] `cache_dir` in favor of `Config.cache_dir`
- Deprecate [DSL] `source_dir` in favor of `Config.source_dir`

### DSL Changes
- Add `with_embedded_path` to software
- Add `with_standard_compiler_flags` to software
- Add `package_scripts_path` to project
- Add builder DSL methods for `mkdir`, `touch`, `delete`, `copy`, `move`, `link`, and `sync`

### Bug fixes
- Fix a small typo in the project generator (come -> some)
- Update sample software definition for libpng to 1.5.18
- Improved logging output
- Include Chef Sugar in both software and project DSLs
- Documentation updates and typographical fixes
- Change the generated omnibus.rb to use a default homepage that includes the protocol
- Ensure that software fetched via the PathFetcher are cached correctly
- Downgrade FPM to ~> 0.4 - FPM 1.0.0+ uses FFI to attach to some libc functions. This fails on RHEL 5 & 6. As we donâ€™t need a bleeding edge FPM the easiest fix is to just downgrade to the most recent pre-1.0.0 version.
- Always print backtraces when errors occur
- Do not sent ldd/otool to the same file - first steps in allowing parallel builds
- Only rescue `Omnibus::Error` when invoked through the CLI - this will allow other bugs to actually raise at the Ruby level
- Refactor the algorithm for git caching to take into account overrides and missing versions
- Remove nested git directories before incremental caching occurs
- Intelligently parse the project's homepage because Ruby's native URI implementation is buggy
- Fetch all software at the start of the build - this fixes a bug where a build would fail halfway through because of a tiny typo of GitHub outage. Now, all required software is downloaded **before** the build starts, lowering the feedback time for a failure due to networking issues
- Use the fetcher's `version_for_cache` method directly, falling back to `0.0.0` (and a warining) if no version is given
- Require `net/http`, `net/https`, and `net/ftp` in the base fetcher module
- Use -R, not -W1 on FreeBSD's compile flags
- Expand all paths relative to the project_root
- Unset all Ruby, Bundler, amd Gem-related environment variables before shelling out
- Various documentation fixes and updates

### Potentially breaking changes
- Merged `Package` and `Artifact` into the same class and updated API - this was considered an **internal** API so it is not a violation of semver
- Use a common class for Omnibus exceptions - if you were rescuing Omnibus::Error, you might be rescuing all exceptions now
- Use a cleanroom object when evaluating the DSL - prior to this release, Omnibus did not declare a public API. Project and software definitions had unrestricted access to the entire project.rb and software.rb methods respectively. This poses two problems - first, it makes it impossible to guarantee a public DSL API over a public (code) API. Second, it permits a developer to change the behavior of project.rb or software.rb accidentially, simply by defining a new method. The introducing of a cleanroom fixes both these bugs, however, it was impossible to know what was formerly considered a public API. Thus, it is possible that a previously-relied-on method is now unavaiable using the cleanroom. Please open an issue if you encounter such a case.
- Remove mixlib-config - if you were relying on mixlib-config as a transitive dependency, it is no longer available
- Remove the ability to use an overrides file - this was for internal use only and was never exposed as a public API. However, if you dug into the code and found it, it has now been removed. For BC purposes, the value still exists in the configuration object, but is essentially a no-op
- Move project loading from INFO to DEBUG
- Truncate platforms to short versions
- All paths are represented internally as Unix-style paths - previously Omnibus would try to intelligently build your paths differently on Windows for the purposes of shelling out to the system. This proved to be unmaintainable and makes Ruby very unhappy in most circumsatances. As such, we have exposed the `windows_safe_path` method in the Builder DSL that will convert a string to a "Windows-safe path". This is only needed when shelling out to the system.


v3.1.1 (May 20, 2014)
---------------------
- Update project generators to use new APIs. The old project generators created a project that issued deprecation warnings!
- Stream build output to the debug logger. Specifying `--log-level debug` now includes **all** the build output as if you had run the command manually.
- Deprecate the `OMNIBUS_APPEND_TIMESTAMP` environment variable in favor of the command line flag. This is only a deprecation, but the `OMNIBUS_APPEND_TIMESTAMP` will be removed in the next major release.
- Fix a bug in `windows_safe_path` to always return a string
- Add a `Config.base_dir` configuration value for easy tuning
- Remove the use of `Omnibus.root` in `BuildVersion#initializer`. This removes the many deprecation warnings that print on each software load.
- Output the current command in debug output when shelling out
- Output the current environment in debug output when shelling out
- Change the information that is displayed at different log levels with respect to shelling out. In `warn` mode, Omnibus will only display warnings/deprecations; you will not see any build commands or output. In `info` mode, Omnibus will display the commands and environment that are being used; you will not see the output from the build (unless it fails). In `debug` mode, Omnibus will display the commands, environment, and output (livestream) from commands.


v3.1.0 (May 14, 2014)
-------------------------
### New Features
- `friendly_name` is added to project DSL to be able to configure the name on packagers.
- `resources_path` is added to project DSL to be able to specify project specific resource files for packagers.

- Create a real logger object - Omnibus now supports --log-level
- Warn when incorrectly using `replaces` in a project

### Bug fixes
- Fix Windows bugs in the new git caching feature
- Use the git sha in the git caching so that the software matches "master"
- Force the detaching of all disks before building an OSX DMG
- Remove references to now non-existent Vagrantfile
- Fix an issue where softwares that are both top-level and transitive dependencies were built in the wrong order (see #140 for more information)
- Use `source` when creating software uris and checksums
- Fix invalid cache operations by ensuring the bucket exists
- Add tag output git describe to include lightweight tags
- Remove explicit instance_eval from line 0
- Remove libz and libgcc_s from the health check whitelist

### Miscellaneous Changes

- Lazy load Ohai and Mixlib::Config default values
- Consistent deprecation warnings
- Updated README badges


v3.0.0 (March 27, 2014)
------------
### New Features

- **No more rake!** Software definitions are incrementally built and cached using git instead. Software dependency build has been rewritten to leverage git caching. This means compiled software definitions are cached, so future Omnibus project builds are much faster. However, this does introduce some potential breaking changes.

  - Project-level software dependencies are built **last**.
  - it is assumed that project-level software dependencies are most frequently changed, and thus Omnibus optimize for such a case.
  - If you have software definitions that hard code `always_build`, you will probably want to turn that off now.
  - Blank directories are not cached. If you would like a blank directory to be cached, add a `.gitkeep` file to the folder.
  - The build order is compiled in a different way, which might result in a different ordered-installation than previous versions of omnibus.
  - For an example of you you might need to update your project, please see [opscode/omnibus-software@02d06a](https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-software/commit/02d06a74c02340b592e1864e7ab843bc14fa352a)

- Support for building DMGs (OSX Disk Images)
- Update generator to create assets for pkg/dmg resources
- There's a fancy new logo
- Added Chef Sugar integration
- Improved documentation
- Improved test coverage

### Bug fixes

- Project generators now include apt/yum as development cookbooks
- Added libc++.1.dylib as a whitelist healthcheck
- Added libgcc_s.so,1 as a whitelist healthcheck on Solaris
- Fix a bug where `extra_package_files` would break FPM

v2.0.1 (March 18, 2014)
-----------------------
- Fix the name of the `pkg` artifact created on OSX
- Fix new Rubocop warnings
- Update generated `Gemfile` to use Omnibus 2.0
- Switch to using Test Kitchen for generated build labs
